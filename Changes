0.12 
    - Darwin support! 
    - Minimum Perl version changed to 5.8.0
    - Make platform check compile time constants for performance
        aka The Wilhelm Speedup (thanks to Eric Wilhelm <scratchcomputing@gmail.com>)
    - FFT for real data
    - Numerical derivatives fully implemented
    - Integration subsystem, gsl_integrate_qags() and gsl_integrate_qagi(), etc..
        - QNG    : Non-adaptive Gaussian (uses fixed number of sample points in interval)
        - QAG(S) : Adaptive Gaussian (Singluar) (slices interval up based on properties of the function)
        - QAGI   : Adaptive Gaussian with infinite integration range
        - other are supported but not tested
    - Initial Monte tests
    - Initial Multiroots tests
    - More nan/inf fixes on MSWin32 from <sisyphus@cpan.org>
    - Stripping of binaries on Windows, which significantly reduces size
        from <sisyphus@cpan.org>
    - Full support and tests for all functions in the Sort subsystem
    - Added 'examples/benchmark/sort' to show performance of gsl_sort()
    - Added 'examples/clicker/chart' to show graphing of functions
    - Added 'examples/gsl_repl' which is a rapid protyping tool/interactive interpreter
    - Compile support for GSL's as old as 1.8 (test suite still needs to be properly guarded)

0.10 
    - Continued porting to MSWin32, fixing many NaN and Inf handling issues

0.08

0.042
    - Started change to Test::Class

0.01
    - Added swig interface files and swig-ified build script
