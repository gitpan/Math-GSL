=head1 List of Known Bugs in Math::GSL

* The implementation of callbacks in Math::GSL is duct tape and paper clips. It is very sensitive

 to new and exotic platforms and compilers. 

* Math::GSL subclasses Module::Build and generates compile flags based on system characteristics,

 shouldn't this be in Module::Build ?

* FFT's stopped working! We need some good unit tests, the current one does not use trusted data

* gsl_set_error_handler_off() does not return a gsl_error_handler_t

* gsl_histogram2d_clone() does not return a gsl_histogram_t

* gsl_vector_complex_scale() does not exist in underlying GSL library (will be in GSL 1.12 )

* gsl_monte_function is b0rked

* gsl_min_fminimizer_iterate = exploding hamster

* gsl_root_fsolver_iterate = exploding hamster

* gsl_fft_real_radix2_transform is b0rked (it worked at one point...)
