Gsl - Perl Interface to The GNU Scientific Library
--------------------------------------------------
By Jonathan Leto <jonathan@leto.net>

Currently on the Special Functions of GSL are implemented.

The POD documentation should tell you all that you need to know.
If you want to help me implement other parts of GSL, please
contact me.

This code has not been thoroughly tested at all, and should be
considered alpha software.

This code is release under the GPL Version 2.
